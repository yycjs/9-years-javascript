### 9 years of JavaScript

This time Alexis Abril, host of the DallasJS meetup and long-time Bitovian will join us and together with David share some of the things learned from 9 years of running large corporate and open-source JavaScript projects (the latter of which were never "the hot thing" but are quietly powering some of the top 100 web sites in the world).

We will talk about:

* Lessons learned
* The surprising reasons why projects fail
* Why testing always matters
* How to easily add functional tests to your web application
